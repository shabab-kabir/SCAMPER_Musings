;;; Reflection:
;;; Do you think music should still be valued in light of modern-day computation’s ability to “do it all?” 
;;; If so, what do you personally value about music in spite of this assignment? If not, why do you feel that music has lost its value?

 
; While modern-day computation has undoubtedly revolutionized the way music is created and consumed, I personally believe that music still holds immense value in our lives. 
; Advancements in technology have certainly expanded the possibilities for a variety of musical creations, but they have not diminished the importance of the human touch 
; and emotional connection that is inherent within music. The evolution of music through technology demonstrates our never-ending quest for expression and creativity.

; Music has been an integral part of human culture and society for thousands of years. Its ability to transcend 
; language barriers, evoke emotions, and foster connections between various people is unparalleled. Despite technological advancements, the emotional and cultural 
; significance of music remains. The human experience is intricately woven into the fabric of music, and no computational algorithm can fully replicate 
; the depth and nuance of the human expression (espically since CHAT-GPT makes pretty shitty music).

; Moreover, technology has simply democratized music creation, allowing for people from various backgrounds and skill levels to create and share their art. 
; This has resulted in a diverse array of musical styles and genres, espically in the electronic world, that enrich our lives and expand our understanding of what music can be. 
; Computation has made it easier for artists to experiment with new sounds and techniques, pushing the boundaries of traditional musical structures and fostering innovation.
; Nowadays, most coposers rely heavilly on notational softwares or digital audio work stations for their art.

; Additionally, the human element in music cannot be ignored. While computational algorithms can create impressive and complex compositions, 
; they often lack the emotional resonance that comes from a human composer or performer. An explicit example is human variability. Music is not merely an assembly of notes and rhythms, 
; but rather an expression of the human spirit. The stories, experiences, and emotions that musicians bring to their work contribute to the unique 
; and irreplaceable value of music.

; In conclusion, although modern-day computation has undoubtedly impacted the way we create and consume music, it has not diminished its value. 
; Instead, technology has expanded the possibilities for musical expression and allowed for a greater diversity of voices and styles. The emotional and cultural 
; significance of music remains undiminished, as it continues to provide a unique connection between people and an outlet for human creativity. 
; Music will always be valued, as long as it continues to resonate with the human experience and serve as a conduit for our shared emotions and expressions.
